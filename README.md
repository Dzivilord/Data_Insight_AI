# Data_Insight_AI

## 📊Description

This project applies Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to support and automate key steps in the data analysis process. The goal is to build a complete, end-to-end data analysis pipeline—from data preprocessing and visualization, to machine learning model development and insight generation.

As a team-based project, it emphasizes real-world data handling skills, collaborative development, and effective communication. Throughout the project, we work on:

- Collecting and cleaning real-world datasets

- Visualizing data to identify patterns and trends

- Applying machine learning algorithms for prediction or classification

- Interpreting model results and extracting actionable insights

- Evaluating model performance using appropriate metrics

- Presenting findings through reports and live presentations

This project not only showcases the technical application of AI in data analysis, but also aims to strengthen teamwork, critical thinking, and communication skills in a real data science workflow.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc.
- Tools: Jupyter Notebook / VS Code
- Version Control: Git, GitHub
